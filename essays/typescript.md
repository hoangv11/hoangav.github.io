## Experience with TypeScript

Ever since I started my journey in coding and programming, I've encountered many different programming languages along with their unique uses. After I learned and got pretty good with Java, I would then begin my transtition into a new programming language, C. For me, it was very daunting knowing that I would have to learn and master more than just one language which made me question if I was really cut out for it, but soon after, all my pointless worrying would dissapear. From that experience, I have come to realize that learning new languages was not as hard as I made it out to be. Almost all of the fundamental and basics are consistent across programming languages with varying syntaxes. This made learning new languages become a more exciting thing rather than one to be feared, and because of this I was able to learn other languages very easily such as C++, python and now JavaScript and TypeScript. 

Through completing the 140 problems and familiarizing myself with JavaScript, I came to really like how flexible the programming language is. With the additional features that ES6 provides, it also makes it much easier to simplify the code which improves code readability as well. From then going onto TypeScript was also very easy because TypeScript is just JavaScript with an added layer and being static rather than dynamic. I found TypeScript to be slightly better than JavaScript because of this added layer which I believe to improve the overall maintainability of the code. Overall, I am very excited to get myself used to TypeScript and being able to apply it to develop real world applications that can be used by others.
