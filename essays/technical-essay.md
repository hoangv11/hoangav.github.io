## How Did I Get Here?

I have always been intrigued by computers and tehcnology since I was a child leading me to develop an interest in Software Engineering as well. My interest in software engineering comes from wanting to develop applications and solutions that can have an impact on others. Software engineering is very flexible as you are able to create almost anything you desire stemming from a single idea. During my time studying computer science, I have had a lot of ups and downs as well as times when I had to question "Is this really for me?" All the struggles that I have experienced thus far have been a very good motivator for me to keep pushing and get better and better everyday by learning new things or improving on things that I have already learned.
