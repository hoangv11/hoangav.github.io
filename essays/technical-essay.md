## How Did I Get Here?

I have always been intrigued by computers and tehcnology since I was a child leading me to develop an interest in Software Engineering as well. My interest in software engineering comes from wanting to develop applications and solutions that can have an impact on others. Software engineering is very flexible as you are able to create almost anything you desire stemming from a single idea. During my time studying computer science, I have had a lot of ups and downs as well as times when I had to question "Is this really for me?" All the struggles that I have experienced thus far have been a very good motivator for me to keep pushing and get better and better everyday by learning new things or improving on things that I have already learned. 

## Skills I Hope To Develop 

During my journey in computer science so far through academics or outside projects, I have developed an understanding in some of the core principles of programming such as data structures and algorithms which can be carried on to many of the new skills I hope to develop. I would love to learn and gain more experience in some technical fields such as data science, machine learning and artificial intelligence. 
With the skills I have learned thus far, I strive to continue to polish them through creating new projects or practicing leet code which could also help me later on with technical interviews.
