## How Did I Get Here?

I have always been intrigued by computers and technology since I was a child leading me to develop an interest in Software Engineering as well. My interest in software engineering comes from wanting to develop applications and solutions that can have an impact on others. Software engineering is very flexible as you are able to create almost anything you desire stemming from a single idea. During my time studying computer science, I have had a lot of ups and downs as well as times when I had to question "Is this really for me?" All the struggles that I have experienced thus far have been a very good motivator for me to keep pushing and get better and better everyday by learning new things or improving on things that I have already learned. 

## Skills I Hope To Develop 

During my journey in computer science so far through academics or outside projects, I have developed an understanding of some of the core principles of programming such as data structures and algorithms which can be carried on to many of the new skills I hope to develop. I would love to learn and gain more experience in some technical fields such as data science, machine learning and artificial intelligence. 
With the skills I have learned thus far, I strive to continue to polish them through creating new projects or practicing leet code which could also help me later on with technical interviews. Other than technical skills, I also hope to improve in areas specifically teamwork and communication. By participating more in collaborative projects, I wish to enhance my abilities in working with groups, communication and just striving in a team environment. 


## The Next Step

For my future, I hope to go down the path towards becoming a data scientist. Data science has been especially appealing to me because of my love for math and numbers. Through data science we are able to take raw data and create meaningful insight and predictions with that data. Due to the rapid changes and new innovations in technology, machine learning and aritificial intelligence has also been on the rise. I have also found machine learning and AI fascinating and hope to go down a path that combines the three together.
