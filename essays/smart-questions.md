## Why Ask Questions?

Asking questions is fundamental especially for learning and for personal growth. It is a crucial part of communication which is a very important aspect in becoming a software engineer. As we begin to learn new things it is natural to be curious and asking questions is a way to satisfy that curiosity. We have been asked the quesiton, "Do dumb questions exist?" and the answer to that is no. Every question, when asked with genuine curiosity and the intent to learn, has value. The most important aspect is creating a meaningful and effective question that leads to a satisfying and informative answer. 

## What is a NOT SO SMART question?

As a software engineer or programmer, there are many forums such as StackOverflow where you can ask a question and receive feedback from others. There have been times when we have asked questions and did not receive the exact answer we were looking for. This is likely because the question that was asked was not so smart. Before asking questions on online forums, we should make sure that our questions is not easily answered through simple google searches. We should also make sure that our question is specific and asked in a way for us to receive a proper response. By doing this, we can save not only other people's time, but also our own time trying to get responses from others. Here is an example of a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35683216/whats-the-output-of-this-code-written-in-java">not so smart question.</a>

A user posted this question on stack overflow for the output of a simple java code. The user could easily have gotten the output by compiling and exectuing their own code. Later on, the user mentioned that they actually wanted to understand what going on with the code and how it actually came up with that output, but the question itself did not really specify that. If the user also put some effort into google searching, the user can also understand how the code functions and produce a certain output.

## What is a SMART question?

On the other hand, SMART questions is easy to follow and understand, shows effort and highlights the problem at hand. SMART questions also demonstrate that there was effort put in as well wether it be what they searched on google, or what they did to try and and solve the question on their own.
